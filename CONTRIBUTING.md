# How to contribute to this repository or project

Hi! Welcome! Thanks for actually reading this file.

This is an upstream/sharable version of jculpon's private wierd (net)BSD repo for working on network code that invovles godot engine and netBSD-alikes on ARM or AMD x86 CPUs. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry! It's primarily about having portable network games that do not crash other people's switches and routers. And also consoles based on BSD kernels.

This is an ongoing project but is very much "best effort in jculpon's Copious Free Time". If you would like to contribute code or comments, please either do so via github (jculpon/netbsd-godot-ports) or contact your package maintainer. This is not actually an official portfile. If you got referred here because of a bug, feel free to use the issues/pull requests/discussions features to find out if it is a known issue. If it is not a known issue, feel free to contact jculpon directly and they will do their best to get back to you within a month or two.

Beyond that: this is meant to be shared with game jam participants and students. Please be polite and read the code of conduct and follow general (net) netiquite as outlined by netbsd.org and usenix.org. We all start somewhere and a lot of students never get into "serious" games coding because of how hard it is to follow documentation for open source/free software engines.

Anything authored by jculpon is indicated as such. Submodules and dependencies included in this repository are likely clones/forks of other people's code. Please check each directory for separate README/CONTRIBUTING files in markdown or plain text to see if that applies to a specific component.

The C++ side of this is mostly related to engine compiling. Everything else is, uh, make/rake/cargo/cmake and thar be dragones in those configs.
